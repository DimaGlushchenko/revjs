# RevJS - Rev up your data-driven JS app development!

RevJS is a rapid application development toolkit designed to simplify creation
of data-driven JS apps.

The `rev-api` module provides the API layer for RevJS - allowing you to expose
your models easily via a GraphQL API.

**NOTICE: This project is currently in the alpha stage!**

Breaking API changes are possible without a major version bump. Once we reach
v1.0.0 then we'll be following SemVer :)

Full documentation TODO - check out the `examples` folder to get started!
