# RevJS - Rev up your data-driven JS app development!

RevJS is a rapid application development toolkit designed to simplify creation
of data-driven JS apps.

The `rev-api` module provides the API layer for RevJS - allowing you to expose
your models easily via a GraphQL API.

**PLEASE NOTE: This project is currently in alpha**

Breaking API changes are possible while we refine the way the modules interoperate.
Once we reach version 1.0.0 then we will be following strict semantic versioning.
