# rev-models - RevJS Data Models

The `rev-models` module provides the following:

 * A set of **Built-in Field Types** for defining your
   data models
 * A **ModelManager** object, which holds the list of
   your registered models, and provides functions for **create**, **read**,
   **update** and **delete**.
 * An **in-memory** storage backend, so you can play with RevJS functions without
   needing to set up a database.

*Jump to the [rev-models API Documentation](/api/rev-models)*

## Storage Backends

In addition to in-memory storage, the following backends are available:

The `rev-backend-mongodb` module provides a **MongoDBBackend** class which stores
and retrieves data from a MongoDB No-SQL database. Jump to the
[rev-backend-mongodb API Documentation](/api/rev-backend-mongodb).

The `rev-api-client` module provides a **ModelApiBackend** class which stores
and retrieves data from the GraphQL API generated by `rev-api`.
Jump to the [rev-api-client API Documentation](/api/rev-api-client).
