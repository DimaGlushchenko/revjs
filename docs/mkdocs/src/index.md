# RevJS - Rev-up your data-driven JS app development!

RevJS is a suite of JavaScript modules, designed to speed up development of
data-driven applications.

This is achieved by removing the need for boilerplate **Database**, **API** and
**User Interface** code and allowing developers to focus on the data-model and
business logic, i.e. the "important bits" of your application!
