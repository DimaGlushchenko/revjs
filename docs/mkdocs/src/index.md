# RevJS - Rev up your data-driven JS app development!

## What is RevJS?

RevJS is a suite of JavaScript modules designed to speed up development of
data-driven JS applications.

This is achieved by removing the need for boilerplate **Database**, **API** and
**User Interface** code, and allowing you to focus on your data-model and
business logic, i.e. the "important bits" of your application!

ResJS modules are designed for use with **TypeScript**, to give you all the
benefits of strong typing and intellisense, however they should work with
standard ES6+ too. (we're looking for someone interested in creating and
maintaining a revjs ES6+ guide!...)

## Modularity

We've designed RevJS modules so they can be used independently. For example, you
can use `rev-models` on its own as a simple ODM for managing your data, or you
can use `rev-models` and `rev-api` together to quickly create a GraphQL API.

We've been careful not to tie RevJS to any particular database or HTTP
framework, and our front-end components are provided as higher-order React
components, which should be usable with any react UI components, including React
Native.

For details of the current RevJS modules, see [Components](components.md).

## Examples

(TODO)

* Defining and using data models
* Create your own GraphQL API in 1 minute
* Creating a data-driven form with validation
