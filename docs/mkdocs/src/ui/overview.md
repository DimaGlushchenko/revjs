# Building a UI with RevJS

The `rev-ui` module of RevJS provides a number of React components designed to
help you quickly build data-driven user interfaces.

When combined with `rev-api-client`, you can render data from your API with
a very minimal amount of front-end code.

We've created a set of Material UI components that can be used with `rev-ui`,
however **it can be used with any React-based component library**, including your
own custom components.
